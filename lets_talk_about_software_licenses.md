## I'm not a lawyer

* I'm a software engineer
* All I know comes just from reading the licenses (i.e. RTFL)
* Please don't sue me

---

## What is a software license?

* A legal instrument
* Controls the use and distribution of software
* On most countries is tied to the copyright law
* Allocates liability and responsibility between the parties

## What is Copyright?

According to Wikipedia:

> Copyright is a legal concept that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution, usually for a limited time, with the intention of enabling the creator of intellectual wealth to receive compensation blah blah blah...

---

## Copyright

The copyright allows the creator (or copyright holder) to do pretty much whatever he or she wants to do with his or her creation, including allowing others to use it or redistribute it (within certain limits).

---

## What is a software license?

Written permition given by the copyright holder to third parties that restricts how they can use or redistribute a piece of software.

# Liability

## Liability

Software licenses usually include provisions which allocate liability and responsibility between the parties entering into the license agreement.

---

## Software license

* It can protect the developer from unintented problems caused by the software.
* It can provide warranties to the user of the software.

---

## Kinds of software licenses

* Proprietary software licenses
* Free or Open Source software licenses

---

## Proprietary software licenses
 
* A software publisher grants the use of one or more copies of software under the end-user license agreement (EULA).
* The publisher retains ownership of those copies.
* Without acceptance of the license, the end-user may not use the software at all.
* They restrict what the user can do:
    - Reverse engineering
    - Simultaneous use of the software by multiple users
    - Publication of benchmarks, performance tests or even reviews.
    - Participation in a class action suit
    - Profit from the results of the usage of the software
* **They may contain rules that restricts privacy** (&larr; WTF?!?!?)

# Important Tip #1:<br/>Proprietary &ne; Paid

---

# *Freeware*<br/>is usually<br/>**Proprietary Software**

---

# Free or Open Source<br/>Software Licenses

---

## Free or Open Source software licenses

There are two kinds of free or open source software licenses:

* Permissive licenses
* Copyleft licenses

---

## Permissive licenses

* They impose a minimal set of requirements on how the software can be redistributed or used.
* They usually give unlimited permission to use, study, and privately modify the software.
* They allow the user to take the code and use it as part of closed-source software.

---

## Examples of permissive licenses

* [BSD License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license)
* [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_license)

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

---

## Copyleft licenses

* They try preserve the freedoms that are given to the users by ensuring that all subsequent users receives those rights (i.e. they contain viral terms).
* They give users unlimited freedom to use, study, and privately modify the software.
* Thet give the freedom to redistribute the software or any modifications to it (as long as the terms and conditions of the license are met).
* Any modifications made and redistributed by the end-user must include the source code for these
* Any derivative work must not put any additional restrictions

---

## Examples of copyleft licenses

* [GNU General Public License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) (and derivatives)
     - Version 1 (source-code access, modified versions have to be distributed under the same terms)
     - Version 2 ("liberty or death" clause)
     - Version 3 (patents, compatibility, tivoization)

# Important Tip #2:<br/>Free Software &ne; Freeware

---

# Important Tip #3:<br/>Free Software &ne; Open Source Software

---

## Free software

A piece of software is said to be Free Software if its users have the following freedoms:

* Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
* Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
* Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
* Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

This means that Free Software HAS to be distributed under a copyleft license

---

## Open source software

* Open Source software licenses alkows the source code to be used, modified and/or shared under certain restrictions.
* They have fewer restrictions than Free Software licenses.

---

## Free or Open Source software licenses

# Important Tip #4:<br/>DO NOT MIX LICENSES

---

## DO NOT MIX LICENSES

* Not all licenses are compatible to each other.
* If you combine components with incompatible licenses, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR WORK.
* Some Free Software/Open Source Licenses contain exceptions that allows combinations.

---

## Mixing

* Using code from third-party components into our own.
* Linking (statically or dynamically) components with our own.
* Some software licenses (LGPL, MPL, Apache) have exceptions that explicitly allow linking.

---

# Important Tip #5:<br/>Think before you distribute

---

## Think before you distribute

* Distribution means making copies of the software (or its source code) available to the user
* Distribution can also mean providing a service through a web site

---

## Think before you distribute

* Once you've distributed software under a license, there's no turning back
* If you're the copyright holder you can change the license of subsequent revisions of the software
* Software can be distributed under multiple licenses (at the user's choice)

---

## Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL)

* Allows the work to be linked or used with a non-(L)GPLed program.
* It's safe to dynamically link libraries.
* It's safe (according to the FSF) to inherit classes from LGPL libraries.

---

## The ASP loophole

* Using but not *distributing* the software, the copyleft resitrictions are not triggered.
* The Affero General Public License was created specifically to close this loophole.

# Important Tip #6:<br/>Do not use software<br/>for which you don't know<br/>its license

# Important Tip #7:<br/>READ THE LICENSES<br/>(please)
